I"!<p>It has been a few months since my last post, been primarily shooting kids hockey games since the last post, though stay tuned for another post soon with some travel photos.</p>

<p>This week after the Christmas Holiday we had the Holiday Jamboree at the Maryville University Hockey Center.</p>

<p>The Chesterfield 8U White Team that was thrown together at the last minute played 5 games, ultimately going 3-2.</p>

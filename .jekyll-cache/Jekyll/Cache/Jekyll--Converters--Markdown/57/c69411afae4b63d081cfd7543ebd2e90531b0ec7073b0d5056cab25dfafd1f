The name Rallycrossed comes from Rainbow Landmarks, one of the great (if I do say so myself) photos was the shot above of the Sydney Opera House on a trip to Australia in 2012.</p>

<p>The double rainbow presented itself over the harbor and I couldnâ€™t resist running around to get the perfect angle on the Opera House. A couple of years later, while visiting San Francisco, I happened to catch a rainbow over the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>

<p>The combination of these two events and the works produced gave us the name to use for our photography business.</p>

<p>Do you have an event (bike, car, running, crossfit) that you would like me to attend? <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/Contact">Feel free to reach out and see if schedules align</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my work!</p>

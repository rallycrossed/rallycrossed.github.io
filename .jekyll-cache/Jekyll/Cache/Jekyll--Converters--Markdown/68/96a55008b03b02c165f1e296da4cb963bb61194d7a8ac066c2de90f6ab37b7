I"�<p>Once again I spent a day (8/29/2021) out at Indian Camp Creek Park shooting a mountain bike race. This time I was shooting the Missouri Interscholastic Cycling League 2021 Race Series Race #1.</p>

<p>Use the “search” on my smugmug site to more easily find your photos by Bib number, I manually tagged every phone with a bib number if I could read your number plate, if not, sorry you didn’t get tagged.</p>

<p>I tried to get a shot of every competitor, I am pretty sure I missed a couple though, sorry parents!</p>

I"'<p>I took my son out to Indianapolis Motor Speedway over the weekend to catch the Sunday races of the 2021 SCCA RunOffs. We had a blast out there, I may have been to IMS once about 29 years ago for a tour, but this was the first time there catching any racing.</p>

<p>I’m still working on my road racing shots, so while I took a few thousand photos, I pruned thousands of them out for being too blurry based on me playing around with camera settings. Even if you don’t find your car here, I might have a shot of you, <a href="https://chrishammond.com/contact/">feel free to reach out</a>.</p>
